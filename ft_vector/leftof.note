std::allocator::alloate does not construct objects pointed by

++itrator-- ---> tmp = iterator; iterator-- (1) & tmp++ (2)  // iterator reamains decremented 

POINTER operator->() This is called the "drill-down behavior." 
	if obj->x return type is not a pointer then it perfoms:
	returned_obj.operator->() ... and so one util it reaches to a pointer;
	then the memober lookup is handled by the language;
